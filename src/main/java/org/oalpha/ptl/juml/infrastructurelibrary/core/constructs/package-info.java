/**
 * The package Constructs also contains a number of fine-grained packages, and
 * brings together many of the aspects of the Abstractions. The metaclasses in
 * Constructs tend to be concrete rather than abstract, and are geared towards
 * an object-oriented modeling paradigm. Looking at metamodels such as MOF and
 * UML, they typically import the Constructs package since the contents of the
 * other packages of Core are then automatically included.
