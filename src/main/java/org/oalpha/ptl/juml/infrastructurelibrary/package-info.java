/**
 * The first top level package is InfrastructureLibrary, which defines a
 * reusable metalanguage kernel and a metamodel extension mechanism for UML. The
 * metalanguage kernel can be used to specify a variety of metamodels, including
 * UML, MOF, and CWM. In addition, the library defines a profiling extension
 * mechanism that can be used to customize UML for different platforms and
 * domains without supporting a complete metamodeling capability. The nested
 * packages of the InfrastructureLibrary are Core and Profile. The other top
 * level package is PrimitiveTypes, which consists of a small number of
 * primitive types that are commonly used for metamodeling. The PrimitiveTypes
 * package is imported by nested packages in the InfrastructureLibrary and can
 * be imported by other packages, libraries and metamodels that need to define
 * primitive data.
